My website, the place where you are reading this, was a small project I worked on for 2-3 days. I wanted one place to post records of the projects I have worked on, as well as resources for people working on those projects with me.

I wrote this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open source, simple, static website generator. I setup the websites layout, header, etc. using HTML and SASS, but Jekyll allows me to type the main content on each page in Markdown.

In addition, Jekyll provides support for [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating which allows automatic-writing of HTML code based off of variables defined in each pages YAML header. This can be seen in action on the [projects page](/projects.html).

I also use [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the new Bootstrap icons.

I included [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) so I could write LaTeX math equations like this:

$$ \int_m^{2m} \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln(2) $$

Unfortunately, MathJax does not allow the use of the `usepackage` command meaning that I can only use the base LaTeX functionality.

Finally, I got kramdown, Jekyll's Markdown interpreter, to use [rogue](http://rouge.jneen.net/) to perform syntax highlighting.

```python
import math
math.pi = 3

def circle_area(r):
    return math.pi * r * r

r = int(input("Enter Radios: "))
print("The Area Is:", circle_area(r))
```

That's it! If you want to set something like this up, feel free to clone [this projects github repo](https://github.com/brandon-feder/brandon-feder.github.io).
