***From 12/10/22:*** I wrote this for my creative writing class.

I have so many great memories with you<br>
Like when we’d go to the mall, and to the zoo<br>
And I’d ask for a scoop of ice cream, but you gave me two.

And when we went on that Disney cruise<br>
When I tripped over a wire and got a bruise<br>
That was an innocent ruse

I wanted you to hug me and tell me I was okay<br>
I remember being tired, and next to you I’d lay.<br>
These are the moments I think about almost every day

I hate myself for not realizing what was to come sooner<br>
Thinking that the doctors would soon find a cure<br>
Even when across your naked head you had 20 sutures

Even when you couldn't remember my name<br>
Or when I left school early and to the hospital I came<br>
As your lungs filled with water but besides you I played a phone game

And now you’re gone and I feel my family has moved on<br>
Like they don’t realize your gone

And Poppy has gotten remarried<br>
And we no longer visit where you were buried

Even in your good memories, I don't rejoice<br>
I can’t even remember your voice

And the last place I saw you will forever be in your cascit
