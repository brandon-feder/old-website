***From 12/10/22:*** I wrote this for my creative writing class.

I have so many great memories with you<br>
like when we’d go to the mall or to the zoo<br>
or when I’d ask for a scoop of ice cream, but you'd give me two.

On that Disney cruise,<br>
when I tripped and got a bruise,<br>
that was an innocent ruse.

I wanted you to hug me and tell me I was okay.<br>
Sometimes I pretended to be tired so next to you I could lay.<br>
These are the moments I think almost every day.

I hate myself for not realizing what was to come sooner.<br>
Thinking that the doctors would soon find a cure,<br>
even when across your naked head you had 20 sutures

even when you couldn't remember my name,<br>
even when I left school early and to the hospital I came,<br>
even as your lungs filled with water, beside you I played a video game.

Everyone has moved on<br>
like they don’t realize your gone.

Poppy has gotten remarried<br>
and we no longer visit where you were buried.

Even in your good memories, I don't rejoice.<br>
I don't remember your voice.

And the last place I saw you will forever be in your cascit.
