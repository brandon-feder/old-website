title: "My NixOS Config"
---

I am not great about cleaning up after my linux-experiments. In an attempt to help my future self, I have started using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/){:target="_blank"}. NixOS gives a declerative way to configure my operation system meaning any software I want to install, service I want to enable, and all configurations are setup explicitly. I am gaurenteed that whats running on my computer is EXACTLY what I want. You can view my config [here](https://github.com/brandon-feder/nixos-config){:target="_blank"}.
