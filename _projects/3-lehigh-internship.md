In summer 2023, I interned at Lehigh University under Dr. Rosi Reed.

The [sPHENIX](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/sphenix.php){:target="_blank"} experiment is a detector on  aims to study [quark-gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma){:target="_blank"} by colliding bunches of heavy-ions accelerated by Brookhaven's [Reletavistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/physics.php){:target="_blank"}.

sPHENIX contains many subsystems including several [calorimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimeter_(particle_physics)){:target="_blank"}. A collision's [reaction plane](https://indico.cern.ch/event/612333/contributions/2564859/attachments/1447601/2230773/Anjali_AliceIndia_VECC.pdf){:target="_blank"} is important in analysys of the quark-gluon plasma. The distribution of energy deposited by a collision onto these calorimeters can be used to approximate this reaction plane. During my time at Lehigh, I researched statistics relating to how well the detector approximated the reaction plane.
