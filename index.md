## About this page

Hello. My name is Brandon Feder! I am a highschool math and computer science enthusiast. Chances are, if I am not doing school work, you can find my programming or solving some math problem on my laptop and iPad.

To see what I am up to, visit the [projects page](projects.html).

I also have to lovely cats: Loki and Lila. Here is Loki and I.
